        "\n",
        "- **Holdout Validation:** A random data subset is reserved for validation, with the remaining data used for training. This method is simple and fast but may result in high variance due to random selection.\n",
        "- **k-fold Cross-Validation:** Data is divided into k equally sized subsets. The model is trained k times, with each subset used once for validation and the other k-1 subsets for training. Performance metrics are averaged across k iterations, providing a more accurate estimate and reducing variance.\n",
        "- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation:** Similar to k-fold cross-validation, but with k equal to the number of data points. This method is computationally intensive but can provide a more accurate estimate, especially for small datasets.\n",
